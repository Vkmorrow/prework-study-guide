# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for the project was to create a study guide that will help me and others while we are learning to navigate the world of coding. 
I built this project so that during the bootcamp I can reference the work that I have already done and be able to use the information and skills from the prework during the bootcamp to help me complete projects.
The problems it solved were teaching me how to navigate GitHub, Gitbash and VS because I had little experience before beginning the bootcamp. I learned the commands for GitBash, how to open VS through GitBash, how to create and submit pull requests, how to open Chrome Dev Tools on the keyboard, the different ways to style a webpage using CSS, how to add and commit things on GitBash and many more things.

## Usage

This prework study guide is useful because each section of the study guide contains notes about each topic including CSS, JavaScript, HTML and Git. Each section gives a short descrition of what those who read it will see when looking over the prework study guide. The codes such as git commit and git push were taught during this prework study guide are useful and will continue to be useful through the bootcamp.
